Please state what is black box testing? How about white box testing? You can also give an
 example.
 
Black box testing is a software testing method in which a part of the internal structure 
is tested but is not known by the tester.E.g. When we test a website using a browser without 
knowing the internal code. E.G. DECISION TABLE TESTING, STATE TRANSITIONS TESTING.

White box testing is a software testing method that is opposite the blackbox testing by 
meaning the tester will test the internal structures of an application. EXAMPLE: UNIT TESTING.
